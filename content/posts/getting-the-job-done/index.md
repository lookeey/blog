At some point, I decided to get myself a blog. A place to get things I do displayed, elaborate on thoughts and organize my ideas somewhere more coherent than my mind.

So far, this is my second post, but I'm sure I could have written more by now. This is an issue that has become obvious and almost concerning at times for me: I'll often waste more time setting up things than actually getting them done. I'm actually proud of writing this second post, shows how far I've come on this project. Even if I took some time to set this up, I could have actually taken a lot longer. This is because of a recent change in my mindset that I believe will be very beneficial to me both now and in the future.

# Web Technologies

I'll take web development as an example here as it's the area in which I have the most insights, so I do not claim that those problems are the same in every other part of the software development industry.

Web technology is a *very* active department. The web is everywhere you look, and apart from backends, it's based on our old, ever-evolving language set: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Some may say that other forms of application development have grown and taken space in the industry, such as those used to build mobile apps. But the truth is that developers seem to really like HTML, CSS and JS. Take a look at the top frameworks used for mobile development below. (by the way, there are a lot of those, right?)

If you intend to distribute your app to at least two different platforms, like Android and iOS (which is very likely), you'll benefit a lot from using one of those cross-platforms. Among those, you see: *React* Native, Cordova, Ionic, NativeScript, PhoneGap. Together they had a majority of the market share last year.  Even if there's a rise of applications that use the new Flutter UI framework, your old web stack still dominates the market.

Also, as you might know, JavaScript also takes its share in the world of desktop applications. Electron is a framework that uses Chrome's V8 engine to essentially run a web browser window with access to Node.JS APIs. A polarizing approach, for sure, but it's an idea that had great success.
  
Yes, this is the biggest user client development ecosystem out there, and as you might expect, it gives you a wide array of options on frameworks, libraries and platforms to build on. Sounds great, right?

## Dependency hell, but not as you think

It's very easy to get lost in the sea of frameworks available. New products arrive to solve problems and make earlier products obsolete, so each new framework is labeled as the future of development, marketed with the promise that it will solve your problems as a developer while also providing a better experience for the end user.

When a developer with enough willpower decides that a solution isn't good enough, they'll try to *create* another solution. Hence, this well-known [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) comic comes to play:

It's good that there are strong, bold people willing to bring change to the way software is made and improve it, and it's what drives it all forward.
