Have you ever seen someone stop and stare at something that they are impressed by and say: "That's art!"?

People usually say this in a hyperbolic tone when they finish their work or do something they're proud of. But this bugged me out. Why would they say that? Is art really just another word for "impressive"? What *is* art anyway?

So I started to think about it. First, what do people call art?

## "Art"

A lot of things can be called art. Among them: painting/drawing, sculpting, music, writing, dance, etc. Not to use the term "visual arts", that is. Those are just a sample of the many things that are categorized into art. It would be reasonable to say that all of those things involve some sort of expression. The artist, who produces the art, attempts to communicate a message through an unusual, different means; one that is supposedly more efficient, detailed or abstract.

From this point of view, art refers to an alternate way of communication than what we use most frequently in our lives, such as colloquial language. Using different methods, the artist tries to convey ideas that are difficult to express, such as feelings, or expand on simple concepts. An interesting thing about defining art this way is that it opens room for elaboration: if art is communication, it means that necessarily, for something to be considered art, it must involve at least two parties: the communicator and the recipient. There is the artist, and the art's consumer, be it a critic or whoever else. As such, art is not just about the artist, it's also about whoever is going to perceive it.

However, thinking like this has its caveats. Communication is the transmission of information, or messages. This implies that art requires a message. Now, *does all of art really involve sending or receiving a message?*

## Messages in art

Even if art involves giving form to an idea, (through the creation of the artwork) not all of it is _about_ a subject sending a message. There are cases where the artist might have had a concept in mind when creating the artwork, but the importance of this concept is only relevant to the process of creation, so the final result is a mere shadow of the artist's idea. In some cases, the artist tries to contextualize their work by giving it a suggestible name, so to connect the consumer to their original idea. But the work *itself* does not say anything. An example of this is abstract, or non-figurative art, which most often does not encompass objective information.

What are those works for, then?

### The beauty of art

When a piece of art does not express strongly objective ideas, its interpretation is up to the observer. This is where the communication argument falls short.

Artwork, in this situation, can be understood in another way. The artist, led by whatever intention they have (be it expression, protest, study or anything else) creates a substrate -- the artwork -- that the consumer can use to aid them understand a concept. In this way, the artwork is a catalyst, which does not alter the product significantly but especially helps in its production: the formation of a solid idea.

Alright. So art can either be:
- a message, put in another way
- a tool to build ideas on

right?

## Art is not just for nerds

Let's not forget one of the main reasons why art has been so popular and big. People like art for one thing, perhaps above everything else:

### Art is enjoyable

The greatest part of the population likes art because it's pleasing. Sometimes they don't even care that much about the message, how they feel about it or what they can make out of it. For them, it may represent something vain as entertainment or a fun pastime. There is nothing wrong about that, and in fact, that's a good thing. Art is a very transmittable form of communication, because the underlying message can be disguised in entertainment, in the form of recreation.

Sometimes, the act of improving anything in both functionality or aesthetic can be considered art. Take for example architecture or product design. Not art for the sake of thought or information, but just making something better than it already is.

Art can be a message, a canvas for feelings and ideas, a product, entertainment,

or anything that people do and that other people are impressed by.

A lot of things. It's a very vague term indeed. Perhaps we need more words for art.

Either way, I still don't know what art really is.
