Have you ever seen someone stop and stare at something that they are impressed by and say: "That's art!"?

People usually say this in a hyperbolic tone when they finish their work or do something they're proud of. But this bugged me out. Why would they say that? Is art really just another word for "impressive"? What *is* art anyway?

So I started to think about it. First, what do people call art?

## "Art"

A lot of things can be called art. Among them: painting/drawing, sculpting, music, writing, dance, etc. Not to use the term "visual arts", that is. Those are just a sample of the many things that are categorized into art. It would be reasonable to say that all of those things involve some sort of expression. The artist, who produces the art, attempts to communicate a message through an unusual, different means; one that is supposedly more efficient, detailed or abstract.

From this point of view, art refers to an alternate way of communication than what we use most frequently in our lives, such as colloquial language. Using different methods, the artist tries to convey ideas that are difficult to express, such as feelings, or expand on simple concepts. An interesting thing about defining art this way is that it opens room for elaboration: if art is communication, it means that necessarily, for something to be considered art, it must involve at least two parties: the communicator and the recipient. There is the artist, and the art's consumer, be it a critic or whoever else. As such, art is not just about the artist, it's also about whoever is going to perceive it.

However, thinking like this has its caveats. Communication is the transmission of information, or messages. This implies that art requires a message. Now, *does all of art really involve sending or receiving a message?*

## Messages in art

Not all of art is about a subject sending a message.
